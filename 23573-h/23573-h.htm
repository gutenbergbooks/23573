<h3>MEMORIES OF THE PAST.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 106px;">
<img src="images/004.png" width="106" height="100" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p class="firstp"><span class="dcap">s</span> I sit here on the demolished
walls of Fort Pandapatan,
contemplating
the magnificent scene
spread out before me,
my mind reverts
to that awful Battle fought on the 2d
of May of this year, which was rightfully
designated by General Adna R.
Chaffee as the hardest fought battle of
the entire Philippine insurrection.
And as I look down the grassy slopes
of Pandapatan hill, and across the open
towards Binidayan hill, on which once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
stood that impregnable Moro stronghold,
Fort Binidayan, I can see in fancy
those advancing lines of determined
men and hear the awful screech of flying
projectiles, just as if that terrible
drama of reality were being enacted
over again for my own especial benefit.</p>

<p>And while I am in the mood and
have the inspiration to do so, I shall endeavor
to convey to the reader a slight
conception of what the Battle was like,
and how it appeared to me on that eventful
day, and which will go down in history
as one of the most glorious feats of
American arms.</p>

<p>I can see again, in fancy, that column
of determined fighting men, at the
head of which rode General (then Colonel)
Frank D. Baldwin, struggling
over the slippery mountain trails, fording
the swift running rivers, and sweltering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in the hot tropical sun, just as
they did on April 17, 18, and 19, 1902.</p>

<p>It does not seem that several
months have elapsed since General
Chaffee issued an ultimatum to the Sultan
of Bayan and other leading Moros
of the Lake region, demanding the surrender
of several Moro tribesmen for
the murder of Pvts. Lewis and Mooris
of the 27th Infantry, in March last, and
for the return of several horses which
had been deliberately stolen from Lieut.
Forsyth, 15th Cavalry, at Buldoon, a
small village in the mountains along
the south coast of Mindanao.</p>

<p>When General Chaffee visited the
little town of Malabang in the early part
of April, inviting the Sultans and Dattos
of the Lake region to come in and
hold a friendly conference with him,
little did he dream that he was taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the first step in what was to be one of
the most aggressive campaigns ever
inaugurated.</p>

<p>But when, instead of complying
with the terms of the ultimatum, the
Moros insolently replied to it and defied
the Americans to come and fight, General
Chaffee realized then that the situation
was grave indeed, and accordingly
telegraphed to Washington immediately
for permission to proceed to the
Lake region and administer a lesson to
the recalcitrant Sultans and Dattos.</p>

<p>But it was not until after much delay
that the War Department reluctantly
gave permission to proceed against
the Moros, and General Chaffee was
cautioned not to go to the extreme of
warfare, until every peaceful method
had been exhausted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE FIRST ADVANCE.</h3>

<p>Preparations were at once begun;
an expedition was formed and got in
readiness, and on April 17, 1902, six
companies of the 27th Infantry, two
troops of the 15th Cavalry, and the 25th
Battery of Field Artillery started for
the interior of Mindanao, which had, as
yet, never been explored by white men.</p>

<p>The troops constituting that column
were, for the most part, raw material,
having been organized but a short
time previous to the time of which I
write, and had as yet seen but little of
active service.</p>

<p>But it must not be imagined that
they were all inexperienced in warfare,
for in its ranks were many who had
either transferred from other organizations
or who had voluntarily enlisted in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
these organizations, and who had seen
service in more than one war.</p>

<p>It is needless to narrate how the
column marched over the first great
mountain range which follows along the
southern coast in a parallel line, and
then on to the enemy infested region
about Lake Dapao, which is but a forerunner
of a more impregnable region,
and which is now gradually resuming
its former peaceful aspect, and which
in time will develope into one of the
most productive regions in the Philippine
Archipelago.</p>


<h3>THE ENEMY ENCOUNTERED.</h3>

<p>Suffice it to say that after three
days of hardships and privation, those
troops, constituting what was known as
the "Lake Lanao Expedition," encountered
the enemy on a bit of rising ground
at a place known as Gadungan, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
after two engagements fought, one there,
and one at a place known as Fort Pualos,
a camp was established in that vicinity
and negotiations with the Moros
were renewed.</p>

<p>These were but preliminary engagements
and were merely forerunners
of what was to come.</p>

<p>After a useless delay and fruitless
attempt to restore peace, the column
again advanced, this time for the Bayan
Forts.</p>

<p>On May 1 the little army of American
troops arrived at a point on the south-eastern
shore of Lake Lanao, overlooking
the Lake and in sight of the enemy's
stronghold.</p>

<p>At this juncture Brigadier General
George W. Davis, commanding the Seventh
Separate Brigade, and who had been
designated by General Chaffee to personally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
accompany the expedition, arrived
from Malabang after making a flying
trip across the mountains.</p>

<p>A temporary camp was established
and General Davis prepared messages
in Arabic writing, which were
immediately sent to the Sultan of Bayan,
demanding his surrender by noon
of May 2, or suffer the consequences.</p>

<p>These messages are known to have
been delivered but they were not replied
to.</p>


<h3>PRELIMINARY FIRING.</h3>

<p>During the night of May 1, the
American outposts were fired upon frequently
by the Moros, but they did not
reply to the fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>At daylight camp was broken, and
the column pushed ahead in the direction
of Bayan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The column was halted about one
half mile from the first fort.</p>

<p>The Moro outposts opened fire on
the Americans, but they were not replied
to.</p>

<p>The Americans were waiting for
twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>About one thousand yards to the
right and front was a small clump of
bamboo, several natives appeared there,
firing a few shots and flourishing their
weapons, all the time yelling like mad.</p>

<p>It was now plainly seen that the
Moros were determined to have war.</p>

<p>The Artillery was brought into
play and trained on the clump of bamboo
on the right, also Fort Binidayan,
which was situated on the crest of a
high hill about fifteen hundred yards
distant.</p>

<p>Those were indeed moments of
suspense for those gallant troops, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
not a shot was fired by them, although
they were under an almost constant
fire from the enemy.</p>


<h3>HOSTILITIES BEGIN.</h3>

<p>But just at twelve o'clock, General
Davis stepped forward, watch in
hand, and took one long, lingering
look in the direction of Fort Binidayan,
and then, not seeing any signs of a
peace envoy, but, on the contrary, every
indication of hostility, he turned slowly
to Captain W. S. McNair, of the 25th
Battery, and gave the signal to "let
her go."</p>

<p>"Boom," echoed the little mountain
guns, and away went a shrapnel
screaming across the open and just
three and six-tenths seconds after, exploded
immediately over the fort.</p>

<p>Instantly figures were seen hurrying
to and fro about the fort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boom!" went another, this time
at the clump of bamboo on the right.</p>

<p>A puff of smoke, and then,&mdash;a
cloud of dust immediately in front of
the bamboo&mdash;told the tale only too well
to the gunners.</p>

<p>The battle of the Bayan forts had
begun.</p>

<p>Quick movements were observed
here and there, companies were being
assigned their positions, orders were
being transmitted like lightning from
point to point, and in less time than it
takes to narrate it, that body of men
were swung into action like the pendulum
of a clock.</p>


<h3>DESTRUCTION OF BINIDAYAN.</h3>

<p>The work of demolishing the Binidayan
Fort had now begun in earnest,
companies "F" and "G" of the 27th Infantry
advanced in line of skirmishers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
while the Artillery continued a slow fire
on the Fort, company "H" joined "F,"
and crossed the intervening ridge and
then through the little valley, while "G"
went off to the right, to flank Binidayan
and at the same time to make a demonstration
against Fort Pandapatan, which
was to the right and rear of Binidayan.</p>

<p>Fort Pandapatan was the second
fort known as the system of Bayan forts,
of which there are four.</p>

<p>At the base of the Binidayan hill
the Infantry halted for an instant, and
then started up the hill in a long, thin
line of skirmishers, with determination
written in their faces.</p>

<p>It was the initial event of the kind
for many of them, but every head was
erect, every man in his place.</p>

<p>There was not a bit of confusion,
simply an orderly line of men coming
up to do battle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>They were under a constant fire
from the enemy while they were advancing
but they did not reply to them
until they were close enough to plainly
distinguish the heads of the Moros bobbing
up and down in the trenches which
surrounded the Fort.</p>

<p>They laid down prone on the ground
then and poured a withering fire into
the fort and trenches, which quickly
routed the enemy.</p>


<h3>THE CHARGE.</h3>

<p>Suddenly, back on the ridge where
the Artillery were stationed the clear
notes of a bugle were heard, sounding
"Charge."</p>

<p>Instantly those blue shirted figures
away up on the grassy slope, rose as if
by magic, and then pressed forward and
upward, with a yell that was sufficient
in itself to route the enemy, and it did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
route them, for the Moros were fleeing
and falling back on Fort Pandapatan by
hundreds.</p>

<p>The troops reached the very walls
and there paused for an instant&mdash;to gain
breath, then a command rang out, clear
and cool, and it seemed that one mighty
wave swept on and over the walls, and
in an instant more, those standing back
on the ridge where the Artillery was,
saw "Old Glory" unfurled to the breeze
from the shattered walls of Fort Binidayan.</p>

<p>The first position of the enemy had
been taken without loss to the Americans.</p>

<p>But not so fortunate for the Moros,
for here and there a mangled body of a
dusky warrior dotted nature's carpet,
some already dead, others breathing
their last, but stubbornly defying the
Americans to do their worst.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>At this stage of the battle there
came a distinct lull in the firing, and
both sides took advantage of it to "take
a hitch" and prepare for the real battle,
which was yet to come.</p>

<p>During this lull the Artillery closed
up and took their new position on Binidayan
hill, a little to the south of the
fort.</p>

<p>Floating over Fort Pandapatan
there were no less than twenty large
red flags.</p>

<p>Most of the Moros had already fallen
back on this stronghold and they
could plainly be seen, throwing up extra
intrenchments.</p>

<p>It was now two o'clock and the real
work was about to begin.</p>

<p>Companies "E" and "F" started
straight down the Binidayan hill in the
direction of Pandapatan, while "B"
Company was sent to the right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>After the Infantry had crossed the
little valley in front, the Artillery opened
up and the big fight was on.</p>


<h3>THE REAL BATTLE BEGINS.</h3>

<p>The shell and shrapnel flew fast
and furious from those little mountain
guns, accompanied by the music of the
"Krags."</p>

<p>On and on, nearer and nearer up
the hillside came the crash of advancing
troops, smothering other unseen trenches
on their way, until by nightfall
there was not a rifle but could shove its
muzzle into the very face of the trench
behind which the Moro warriors laid in
waiting, peering down the slope between
the explosions for something they feared
more than the whistling fragments
of Krupp shells&mdash;the blue-shirted form
of the silent American soldier, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
whom the Moros knew the ultimate issue
rested.</p>


<h3>EXCEPTIONAL COURAGE.</h3>

<p>On they came, however, up the hill,
silent and straight, hundreds of them,
right into the open below the trench
from behind which the Moros delivered
a withering fire and gasped at the folly
of the Americans.</p>

<p>Up and up they came, the lower
lantacas blasting them off the face of
the earth, but still they rushed on and
upward against the frowning walls.</p>

<p>The mountain guns howled and
roared over them, the walls grew troubled
and shaky, falling in and falling
out, dimly seen between the curtain of
smoke and sheet of flame whirling about
the leaping stones.</p>

<p>But steady eyes were gleaming
where they could through the sheets of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
fire, and steady fingers were pulling
triggers rapidly and incessantly.</p>

<p>The crash came unbroken and
clearly heard from the midst of the uproar
thundering up at the trench, as
if the shells were bursting with a million
rattling fragments, and down the
slope were tumbling the blue-shirted
figures, one under that tree, two over
there by the big boulder, another here
and a dozen more down there, and during
the next two hours there was the
most magnificent display of true courage
and grit ever heard of or seen.</p>

<p>The Artillery roared in anger and
anguish, but apparently of no avail,
for the long streams of fire continued
to pour from the fort with regular intervals,
and more blue-shirted figures
went tumbling down the hill.</p>

<p>But this did not continue very long,
for the Artillery turned loose all its little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
dogs of war and they barked fiercely
and hurled death projectiles into the
fort and trenches with renewed vigor.</p>

<p>Think how you would feel if a person
should hurl a stone at you with a
tremendous shout.</p>

<p>Multiply the stone and shout by
twenty millions, add fire and smoke and
nauseous vapors, and imagine the earth
trembling beneath your feet, with the
air filled with screaming projectiles,
even then you cannot imagine the terror
of that Artillery assault.</p>


<h3>DEFIANT TO THE LAST.</h3>

<p>But the fanatical Moros would not
give up; there they stood in the very
midst of that hurricane of death, calm,
immovable, and indifferent to it all.
Their resistance could not help but be
admired as they stood there calm and
defiant, against that advancing, enveloping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
thunderstorm of musketry. But
it must not be imagined that they were
idle; far from it. If one can imagine
taking a handful of pebbles and hurling
them with a strong force against a
pane of glass, then, and then only, can
one imagine the whirlwind of bullets
which the Moros were pouring into
that little army of Americans out there
in the open.</p>

<p>When it is considered that the
Americans were out in the open storming
this fort while the Moros were
strongly fortified and deeply intrenched,
the fierceness of the battle and the heroism
of the troops can be imagined.
Nothing like it had ever been seen before
and nothing like it ever will be seen
again. Regardless of bullets and the
flying fragments of shell and shrapnel,
Baldwin's men kept steadily onward and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
upward, until they were within a few
yards of that impregnable wall, through
whose portholes there poured a constant
stream of fire. It was like gazing
through the doors of a red hot furnace.
And all the time the swarm of blue-shirted
figures rolled on and upward
until they could have dropped a stone
over the wall.</p>

<p>They had now gone the limit, as they
were very near the dangerous zone of
the exploding shrapnel and were compelled
to halt to keep from being struck
by their own men.</p>


<h3>THE WALLS TREMBLE.</h3>

<p>Suddenly, back on the hill where
the little dogs of war were barking, a
command was heard, "Battery, Fire!"
and the air was filled with flying projectiles
which went screaming and
screeching across the open and striking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the walls of the fort with a mighty
impact, that structure was shaken to
its very foundations. Even untouched,
one felt shaky and uncertain on that
hillside, and one would have felt his
body rending to pieces as he looked
where a shell burst in the midst of a
trench, and heard the filthy squelch
and sharp cries above the roar, and
saw the awful faces through the red
glare and curtain of smoke, and the
mangled corpses of dead bodies hurled
high in the air.</p>

<p>It would make a thrilling scene
for some great war drama. The history
of war has had few situations as
thrilling as this day's battle.</p>

<p>The artillery "let itself go" again
and it was impossible to stand on that
hillside, so fiercely was the breath of
the shells blasting across it in hot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
staggering gusts, the tall dry grass
bending before it, and the air filled
with flying debris, which followed in
the wake of a shell in little circling
whirlwinds. Skimming but a few feet
over the heads of the American fighting
line, the shells would burst upon
the trenches or on the ground below
them, when attackers were so close to
attacked that the gush of oily smoke
hid both, and both the death yell and
the yell of triumph were mingled in
one mighty shout and ceaseless roaring.</p>


<h3>THE ENEMY'S COLORS FALL.</h3>

<p>Boom! went the little war dogs,
then boom,&mdash;boom&mdash;boom&mdash;boom, in
quick succession, and then the wall
crumbled, vanished in parts, and lo! behold!
the flags were down! Their crimson
colors were dangling in mid air for
an instant, then were caught in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
shower of a bursting shrapnel and hurled
to the ground.</p>

<p>Oh! the grandeur of that last few
moments' bombardment! Not a shell
went astray; the parapet received them
all full in the face. In one great explosion
the Moros stood and fired, in one
atmosphere of blasted air and filthy
fumes, in one terrible shadow of the coming
darkness, in one continual earthquake.
They seemed to go mad, as well
they might, for annihilation loomed in
the distance for those who yet remained.
As the soldiers of America drew nearer,
many of the Moros actually leaped from
their cover on to the top of the parapet
and were seen against the sky background,
wildly firing down at the advancing
troops, in the very midst of the
bursting shells.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Hell was surely let loose on those
dusky fanatics who manned the portholes
of Pandapatan. Truly, war <i>is</i>
hell!</p>

<p>They fought with a fanatical frenzy,
but nothing on earth could stop that
line of advancing, invincible soldiers.
Up they went, until at last, it became
necessary for the artillery to cease firing.</p>

<p>The troops reached the very walls,
and there remained, for entrance was
impossible.</p>

<p>However, after fighting hand to
hand until dark, the outer trenches
were taken. With the capture of these
trenches the enemy's position was practically
won. But the Moros did not yet
give up; on the contrary they made preparations
to resist to the death. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
had sworn to die in battle, and they
were admirably carrying out the oath.</p>


<h3>SUFFERINGS OF THE WOUNDED.</h3>

<p>Darkness had fallen now and it
began to rain in torrents. Night fell
terribly for the wounded out there.
That awful cry, "Doctor! This way.
Help!" can be heard to this day. It
continued throughout the night, but
not in vain, for the artillerymen were
out there all night carrying the wounded
off the field and rendering valuable
aid to the surgeons. These men worked
like heroes every one, and deserve the
greatest credit for the magnificent gallantry
shown during that terrible
night's work while under a constant
fire from the enemy.</p>


<h3>THE DEFIANT SULTAN'S DOWNFALL.</h3>

<p>It seemed that a difficult problem
lay before the Americans that night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
It was proposed that a number of scaling
ladders be made and that the place
be carried by assault. Accordingly,
construction on these ladders was begun
at once, but they were destined never
to be used, for at daylight the white
flags were fluttering over the fort and
Pandapatan had fallen.</p>


<h3>A GRUESOME SIGHT.</h3>

<p>At last the big fight was over. After
nearly twenty-four hours of continual
firing the Americans had conquered.
It had been a splendid battle, and what
manner of death the vanquished had
suffered only those who looked into the
fort and trenches after the battle, can
say. The mangled bodies of the Moro
dead were piled up eight and ten deep
in places, and only those acquainted
with the technicalities of a slaughter
house can imagine the sight as it appeared
the next morning after the battle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
But these people would have war,
and war they got, in all its glory. Just
eighty-three survivors remained out
of the hundreds that resisted the
Americans.</p>

<p>But it must not be imagined that
this great victory had been achieved
without loss to the Americans. Their
casualties were far greater than those
of an ordinary battle, numbering close
to a hundred.</p>

<p>With the break of day the gruesome
task of burying the dead began,
and continued throughout the day, and
by nightfall of May 3d the Battle of
Bayan was over and passed, but I cannot
say forgotten, for that can never
be, for the memory of that battle will
ever dwell in the minds of those who
witnessed or participated in that never-to-be-forgotten
event.</p>

that our work along a certain line has

soldier, whose duty is to do battle, praise
for his victories is more than pleasing&mdash;it

<p>Words at my command fail to convey an adequate
expression of admiration for the gallantry and self-sacrifice
which I saw displayed by the assaulting lines
and investing cordon on the 2nd of May. The memory
of this sanguinary action will be treasured by all
participants and observers as long as they live. For
the 27th Infantry and the 25th Battery of Field Artillery,
Bayan will always be an inspiration. At this
moment of exaltation and triumph do not forget the
vanquished foe, whose persistent gallantry commanded
the admiration of all who saw the magnificent
defense of their stronghold. A race of men who have
been able to make such a fight, and who have
turned this wilderness into a garden, have many qualities
which if guided right will make them and their
posterity valuable citizens. None can doubt who have
seen what they have accomplished without the aid
which civilized people enjoy. Let no word or act be
brought home to the American soldier that discredits
or disparages these Moros. Let it be the unremitting
effort of every officer and soldier to assist and elevate
them, a sacred duty which is devolved upon the
Army, an added burden which must be borne; and
every American relies upon our troops to execute this
sacred trust. So far there has been no act of wanton
despoilment, injury or insult; let none ever be charged
to an American soldier. Our flag is an emblem of
freedom and honor, and it remains with you that it
shall become such an emblem to the Moros, and ever
so remain.</p>

<h3>SERMON ON "COURAGE."</h3>

<p>Following is a copy of the admirable
sermon preached by Chaplain George
D. Rice of the 27th Infantry, to the
troops of the Lake Lanao Expedition,
on the Sunday following the battle of
Bayan:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going to speak to you to-day
on courage, and how I saw it displayed
on May 2d, while you were engaged in
open combat with the Moros.</p>

<p>"There was a time when I thought
that true courage was the absence of
fear. But after witnessing the battle
of this week I have seen that which has
caused me to think differently now, because
you demonstrated to me on that
day that true courage is not the absence
of fear, but the conquest of it. Surely,
yours was the highest order of courage.</p>

<p>"I recollect when 'E' Company
came to re-enforce. I turned and watched
three men in skirmish line coming
through the tall grass under heavy fire
from the fort. They knew they were
coming into the thickest of the fire, but
the interval in that line was correct,
every piece right, no shouting or noise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of any sort. Simply a perfect line of
determined men coming up to take part.</p>

<p>"'Tis more than courage, I thought.
It is order, it is discipline and coolness.
And the wounded! Such courage! One
man struck in the leg. We would help
him to the rear; but no, he could crawl
and refused help. Another hit in the
right arm, and he laughed. Then a
bullet struck his left arm and he only
smiled and said: 'They did not treat
me like this in the Panay campaign.'</p>

<p>"Lieut. Wagner was shot in the
stomach and leg, and said to me: 'My
only regret is to leave the fort with my
work unfinished.' I saw one soldier
whom I supposed was dead, I pulled a
shelter-half over him; just then a soldier
came running by. An officer
shouted, 'Where are you going?'
'My ammunition is all gone,' replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the man. I saw the shelter-half
move. In a moment my supposed dead
man was sitting upright. He removed
his belt containing a few cartridges and
gave it to the soldier. I wish I could remember
this man, but there were twenty
or thirty dead and wounded near
there, and they were doing brave and
unexpected things like this all the time.</p>

<p>"Brave Vicars fell, mortally wounded,
leading 'F' Company. Lieut. Jossman
had hardly time to assume command
when he, too, was shot, leaving
'F' Company without an officer, yet
his finely disciplined company held
its line perfectly. A bullet struck
Captain Moore in the head, and as he
rolled into one of the ditches he was
heard to say, 'Do not retreat.' I saw
a wounded soldier making a noble effort
to get out of the line of fire. Who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
would help him? 'I'm going to help
that man if I die for it,' I heard someone
say, as the man repeatedly tottered
and fell, with a terrible wound in his
side. I looked, and in a moment brave
Lieut. Bickham, tall and strong, was
facing the numerous shot and shell to
save his man, and he succeeded. A
bullet passed through Major Scott's hat,
grazed his head, and brought the Major
to his knees, but this officer remained
on the line.</p>

<p>"During that awful fight I saw officers
and men leave their positions in
front of those terrible portholes for two
reasons only&mdash;either because wounded
or to get more ammunition.</p>

<p>"There were hundreds of instances
of heroism occurring about that fort.
When Lieut. Fulmer called for volunteers
to scale the walls, dozens of men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
responded. Lieuts. Hawkins and Wilson
performed noble service, and were
a credit to themselves and their regiment.
Battalion Adjutant Drum, with
his face smeared with powder and the
dust of battle, was as cool as he was
courageous. Captains Phillips, Rogers,
Lyons and Hutton were with their
respective commands, encouraging their
men and doing excellent service.</p>

<p>"It was surely a high order of courage
that caused Sgt. Graves to swing
himself over the outer stockade of Binidayan
when the fanatic Moro and his
knife could be seen above. It was courage
of the most godly type that took
Corporal McGoveren down into the
trenches to prop up the heads of wounded
men and give them water, while
fighting, biting, dying Moros occupied
the same trenches. It was kingly courage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
on the part of Corpl. Keeler, who,
when shot in the leg, refused help, and
said to me, 'I can get to the rear alone,
sir; help someone else.' It was courage
of the Christian soldier that inspired
Sergt. Major Ingold and Sergt.
McCarthy, both wounded, to speak
words of hope to their comrades.</p>

<p>"The courage displayed by the
Moros was very different. The Moros
were caught in a trap. They knew it,
and they fought the desperate fight of
their lives. You can drive a mouse into
a corner like this, and he, too, will
turn. Bravery through necessity is not
the true courage which comes of Christ.</p>

<p>"Officers and soldiers of the 27th
Infantry, I congratulate you to-day.
You have been tested and shown what
you can do. You deserve credit for
what you did, and it is my earnest desire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
that the credit be equally divided.
When you write home to your people
and tell them of the gallant victory of
the 27th Regiment, I want you to remember
to speak of others whose presence
and deeds rendered it possible for
you to accomplish what you did. I want
you to remember the officers and enlisted
men of the 25th Battery. After
the work of the battery was done, the
members of the battery came to the
front with litters made of rifles, bamboo
poles, ponchos, and shelter-halves, with
which they picked up many wounded
and took them to the surgeon. These
men came to the line in squads, each
with litters, asking for wounded men,
and several wounded men owe their
lives to these brave batterymen. They
would go anywhere to get a wounded
man. They faced the thickest of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
fire. A wounded man was pointed out
in a bunch of grass, and the bullets
struck there so fast that one could see
the grass cut off. But these Artillerymen
went there, and in a few moments
had the man safe in a litter. And all
night these noble fellows kept up the
work. They took wounded from the
jungles, the trenches and the open, and
carried them to a place of safety. Let
us never forget the work of the officers
and men of the 25th Battery.</p>

<p>"Captain McNair, and Lieutenants
Clark, Sunderland, and Deems of this
battery are worthy of our praise and
thanks. Major Porter, surgeon, tried
to get on the line to treat a wounded
man when a shot struck him and brave
Porter had to be taken to the rear. Just
behind him I saw hospital corps man
Johnson also trying to reach a wounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
man when Johnson fell into one of the
terrible and dark pitfalls of the enemy,
but got out later and did good work
with the wounded. Young Dr. Allan
deserves credit for dressing numberless
wounds of officers and men in the
trenches close to the fort and under fire
that day. Drs. LeCompte and Grabenstatter
worked like heroes. Major
Anderson, chief surgeon of the expedition,
made every preparation possible
for the care of the wounded officers
and enlisted men. The entire medical
corps remained up all night attending
to the wounded. They deserve great
credit for their work on that rainy,
chilly and dark night under the fire of
the enemy.</p>

<p>"And do not forget the men of the
pack-train. Do you know that these
men brought a pack-train of ammunition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to you over the slippery dangerous
trail that night?</p>

<p>"Captains Shuttleworth and Andrus,
Lieutenants Peck and Fries and
their packers worked hard for you.
They toiled constantly until they had
every wounded officer and man supplied
with tentage, cots, blankets, and
clean clothes. Likewise, kindly remember
the engineers and signal corps
men. Their work in this expedition
will never be forgotten. Our commanding
officer, Colonel Baldwin, never
rested that night. He was up and planning
for the morrow and for you. General
Davis and his orderly and a small guard
rode many miles that night to the next
camp below to arrange for more troops
to come up."</p>

<p>Thus spoke Chaplain Rice, equally
dividing the credit of the victory,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and praising all for their part taken in
the battle. But in all his words there
is one thing that he failed to do, which
is characteristic of this noble man. He
failed to mention his own gallant services,
of which too much praise cannot
be given. Almost from the beginning
of hostilities he was on the firing line,
and up near the fort, speaking words of
cheer and comfort to the men in the
trenches, and "God bless the chaplain,"
are the words of every man of the Lake
Lanao Expedition.</p>

<h2><a name="BATTLE_OF_GAUAN" id="BATTLE_OF_GAUAN"></a>BATTLE OF GAUAN.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 36px;">
<img src="images/006.png" width="36" height="100" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p class="firstp"><span class="dcap">t is</span> night again, the battle
of Bayan is now fought and
indeed very gloriously won.
The last reports of the yet
warm cannon have ceased to
echo through the distant hills
and ravines. The khaki-clad warriors
and laurel-crowned victors, blood stained
and weary from the struggle of the
recent battle, have sought a well earned
and much needed repose. But their
sleep is not one of comfort or rest, for
they have contentedly lain down uncovered
on the cold damp ground.</p>

<p>The shrill notes of the bugle call
them from their dreamy slumbers at
an early hour and their first duty is to
finish burying the dead and lend what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
aid is possible to the sick and wounded,
who were too sick and exhausted at
this time to be removed over the rugged
trails to the hospitals at Malabang.</p>

<p>To do this it was absolutely necessary
to establish a camp, somewhere
adjacent to the centre of hostilities.</p>

<p>It was then that the post of Camp
Vicars, now so widely known throughout
the nations of the earth, first had
its origin. It was so named in honor
of the brave and ever dauntless soldier,
Lieut. Vicars, who unfortunately lost
his life from a wound received, while
heroically engaged in the capture of
the stronghold.</p>

<p>Everything is now placid, hostilities
had ceased for a time at least, the
Moros driven as they were from their
forts, and stockades, which had been
their sole protection for centuries past<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
against all foreign invasion, had sought
shelter from the yet unconquered tribes
wherever it could be had, offering
scarcely any resistance or hostilities to
the troops then at the camp.</p>


<h3>GENERAL CHAFFEE ARRIVES.</h3>

<p>General Adna R. Chaffee soon afterwards
paid a visit to the recently established
camp, arriving with his escort
May 10, 1902.</p>

<p>He was given a full account of the
battles hitherto fought in that region&mdash;Bayan
included&mdash;from officers who
themselves had been daring participants
in all the fights.</p>

<p>He immediately decided to send messages
to the principal sultans and dattos,
who were then commanding tribes
of savage bolomen along the most impassable
regions of the lake shores.
The subject matter of his messages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
were authoritative invitations to come
into the camp and hold a friendly conference
with him.</p>

<p>He received favorable replies from
many of them and two days later the
following named sultans and dattos
decided to respond to his invitation:
Sultan of Genassi; Sultan Amai Tampugao
of Tubaran; Sultan of Binidayan;
Datto Sa Bayang of Bayan; Datto Pedro
of Uato; Datto Agar of Makadah;
Datto Agato of Madatlum; Datto Amay
Mala-Mala of Taburan; Datto Amay
Magatano of Binidayan.</p>

<p>After they had reported it was
thought that the greater part of the
Moro trouble had subsided. But this
was not so&mdash;far from it. Their terms
of peace were, to say the least, short
lived, for in the early part of the month
of July a detachment of men was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
brutally and unexpectedly attacked by
a band of bolomen on the trail. They
were outnumbered by the enemy, and
consequently many of the Americans
were wounded and some three or four
killed outright.</p>


<h3>TREATIES BROKEN.</h3>

<p>It was now very evident, judging
from their recreant action, that the natives
had broken all treaties of peace
and violated the laws of friendship, so
honorably laid down by the Americans.</p>

<p>This evidence of their recriminating
and rebellious nature was doubly
substantiated, when on August 1st the
Sultan of Bacolod, who until then had
remained peaceable, sent to Captain J.
J. Pershing, commander of the troops at
Camp Vicars, the following insolent
message, which is translated below for
the benefit of our readers:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>



<div class="blockquot">
<h4>TRANSLATION.</h4>

<p>We ask you to return to the sea because you should
not be here among civilized Moros, for you are not
religious. If you stay here we will fight you this
month, and in no event will be your friends, because
you eat pork. We say to you that if you do not leave
this region, come here and the Sultan will sacrifice
you, and if you do not wish to come we will come to
you and fight.</p></div>

<p>This was followed in a few days by
another message to the commanding
officer, from the Sultan of Maciu, which
was also of a defiant nature.</p>

<p>Circumstances now began to look
rather grave at Camp Vicars. The
Americans had endeavored by every
means in their power to prevent further
hostilities and trouble, but had failed
in all their efforts to bring about peace
between themselves and the dark-skinned
natives of the trackless plains of
Mindanao.</p>


<h3>A BLOODY DEED.</h3>

<p>The Moros did not, however, make
any advances until the night of August<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
12, when the most appalling and most
ghastly murder that has ever been witnessed
took place about two hundred
yards from the camp. The moon had
disappeared temporarily behind a dark
cloud, the men had all retired for the
night, and everything seemed tranquil,
when suddenly the camp was aroused
by the firing of shots in rapid succession
by the members of the outpost.</p>

<p>The trumpeter was now calling
every slumberer to arms, and in a few
moments the entire garrison was ready
for action. The cries of the men for
help and the crashing of the bolos and
spears could be heard in the calmness
of the dark stilly night. There was no
time for idle thoughts, no time to be
wasted, for it was evident from their
appealing cries that the members of
outpost No. 4 had been attacked by the
blood-thirsty Moros.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieut. Bickham, commanding Company
"F," proceeded in all haste to
cross the deep ravine and re-inforce the
brave men, who, though outnumbered
by a large majority, were nevertheless
fighting desperately for their lives.</p>

<p>They arrived on the scene too late
to prevent the massacre and death of
their fallen comrades, for the savages
had by this time made well their escape,
after performing one of the most savage,
most treacherous and most blood-curdling
deeds, that has ever hitherto been
recorded in the pages of bloody history.</p>

<p>Not content with killing their victims,
they had cut them with their bolos
and long spears, until their bodies
were beyond recognition. The killed
were Sergeant Foley and Pvt. Carey of
Co. "G," 27th U. S. Infantry, men
whose gallantry, kindness, bravery, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
social disposition had won for them
the admiration of not only the members
of their own company, but of
everybody who knew them.</p>

<p>The wounded were Pvts. VanDorn
and Christianson, also of Co. "G."</p>


<h3>A BRAVE STAND.</h3>

<p>Perhaps never in the history of
battles and wars did men fight with
such grim determination and fearlessness
in the very face of death, as did
VanDorn and Christianson of Co. "G."
Having fallen to the ground from loss
of blood and exhaustion, they still
bravely clung with untiring tenacity to
their rifles and never once flinched or
even thought of retreating to a place of
safety until the re-inforcements had arrived
on the bloody scene and the natives
had vanished in the underbrush.
An investigation ensued which disclosed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the fact that the attacking parties
belonged to the tribes of Datto
Amay Grar.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards what was
to be the last ultimatum was issued to
the Moros of the Lake region, particularly
to the Sultan of Bacolod and the
Sultan of Maciu demanding, rigidly,
an explanation regarding the recent
attacks upon the Americans, as well as
the immediate surrender of the murderers
in their tribes who were guilty
of committing various acts of injustice
and cruelty since the historical battle
of May 2.</p>

<p>Their replies were, as usual, of a
defiant, insolent, and sullen nature.</p>

<p>The Americans, seeing that the
restoration of peace in the island of
Mindanao could not be brought about
by fair and honorable means, decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to administer a lesson to them that
they would not very readily forget.</p>


<h3>HOSTILITIES RENEWED.</h3>

<p>An expedition was organized on
short notice, commanded by Capt. J. J.
Pershing, of the 15th Regiment of Cavalry,
a man whose never failing courage,
valor, and ability as an officer and
commander is unexcelled in the American
Army.</p>

<p>Every preparation was made for
the coming events, and on September
17, at midnight, what was known as
Captain Pershing's expedition left
Camp Vicars under cover of darkness
and proceeded through rugged trails to
Maciu's strongholds and neighboring
principalities.</p>

<p>The expedition consisted of Companies
"F," "G," "C," and "M" of the
27th Infantry; Troop "L" 15th Regiment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of Cavalry; and the 25th Battery
of Field Artillery.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th, as
the first refulgent beams of "Old Sol"
had begun to illuminate the eastern
horizon, the column had reached and
halted close by Fort Gauan, and ere
another hour had elapsed the entire
fortification was surrounded by our
troops.</p>

<p>The 25th Battery had halted directly
in front of, and about 300 yards
from, the fort, while companies "M"
and "F," "G" and "C" had formed
skirmish lines on the left and right of
the fort. The command was given for
the first shot to be fired and everybody
waited in silent expectancy for the outcome.
In an instant there was a flash,
and "bang" went the projectile with
lightning velocity, hitting the outer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
breastworks of the enclosure, from
which rose vast clouds of smoke and
fragments.</p>

<p>The firing from the fort was rapid
at first, but gradually diminished as
the outer bombardment continued, and
finally ceased altogether, for the Artillery
onslaught had been terrible while
it lasted, and nothing remained of that
once impregnable fortress save a few
shattered walls, with here and there the
mangled corpse of a dead Moro.</p>

<p>The day was gradually drawing to
a close, which made it necessary for us
to establish a temporary camp for the
night.</p>

<p>This was done, and very fortunately,
adjacent to a small river, which
proved to be a great convenience to
both men and animals.</p>

<p>Natives fired frequently into the
midst of the camp, but fortunately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
without any serious casualty to the
Americans. The first faint glimmer of
dawn that broke over the eastern hill-tops
found us again in readiness and,
after partaking of a hurried breakfast,
we broke camp and again took up the
trail, this time in the direction of Bayubao.</p>


<h3>BAYUBAO VANQUISHED.</h3>

<p>The trails were, in a great many
places, almost impassable, making
marching with equipments very laborious.
However, we arrived at Bayubao
about 2 p.m. and rested for refreshments
on the top of a high hill, which
over-looked the fort and the unruffled
waters of Lake Lanao.</p>

<p>We had not been long in the enjoyment
of our much needed rest, when
the natives, who were until then concealed
in the brush, poured a volley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
into our midst. The entire column was
immediately summoned to action, and
a grander sight could not be witnessed
than to see that body of brave and disciplined
soldiers taking their respective
places and falling into line for action.</p>

<p>The Battery was brought into action
on the hill-top, with the guns
carefully trained on the fort by reliable
and experienced marksmen, then a
noise arose which seemed to echo back
from the very firmaments as if the
giant and mighty mountains had left
their very sockets and were tumbling
in a confused mass into the deep waters
of the lake below.</p>

<p>The Battery had cut loose and
"let her go," and projectile after projectile
was sent from the guns on the
hill-top "straight home" and into the
very midst of the fort, enveloping everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
for a moment in clouds of smoke
and flying fragments, which was almost
suffocating.</p>

<p>Oh! what a strange feeling influences
the soldier when he hears the
first "Boom" of a cannon, for full well
he knows that it is only a stepping
stone leading to the midst of the fray.</p>

<p>The natives returned the fire slowly
but steadily, and in a manner that
was creditable, for they were not only
taken by surprise but were at a critical
disadvantage owing to the elevation.
Still the firing kept up and more than
one dark-skinned foeman could be seen
falling, rifle in hand, lifeless on the
green sward.</p>

<p>They were now growing confused,
ungovernable, and were firing recklessly
like savage maniacs at the unflinching
column of brave American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
soldiers, who were cooly aiming and firing
at the commands of the valiant officers
whenever a well directed shot was
to be had. It now appeared evident that
before this rain of bullets from the Infantry
and the bursting of shrapnel
from the Artillery they could not withstand
much longer, and our position
was such that to hit us at such a range
and elevation was almost impossible.</p>

<p>Again the Battery opened up with
one last and mighty sheet of solid shot
and shrapnel, which made the very
walls tremble and shake like the leaves
of a forest before a hurricane, and
then deathlike shrieks could be heard
from within, the stout walls had crumbled
to a thousand atoms, and the
Sultan of Bayubao, with many of his
tribesmen, had fallen to rise no more.</p>


<h3>IN SIGHT OF MACIU.</h3>

<p>But was this to be our last battle
with the Moros? Was this to be our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
last fight in the desolate island of Mindanao?
No! No! far from it. There
yet remained another, and the stumbling
block of them all, who was at this
time bidding defiance to all invaders, in
his fort across the lake, where we could
see, from our present position, the red
flags of battle waving before the gentle
zephyrs of the orient.</p>

<p>This was the Sultan of Maciu, Maciu
the warlike, who had hitherto held
his stronghold and expansive territories
with creditable success for centuries
against even the haughty Spanish
soldiers. But his day of gloom was
fast approaching, when he and his clan
of bolomen would be compelled to submit
to the sons of America, as will be
seen by the ensuing pages.</p>

<p>Soon after Fort Bayubao had been
taken the column pressed onwards,
down the rugged slope of the trail, leading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
into the fort, and here, being dust-stained,
weary, and footsore, we were
glad to encamp for the night. But only
a few of us slept, for the Moros delivered
a steady fire on us from the surrounding
brush through the night.</p>

<p>The welcomed morning broke
bright and clear over the waters of Lake
Lanao, and the soldiers of "Columbia"
awoke from a dreamy and restless
slumber at the first notes of the bugle.
Preparations for the attack on the Sultan
of Maciu were immediately begun,
but with little or no success, as the
trail leading through the thickly wooded
flats was blocked in such a way
that it was an impossibility for even
the Infantry to force their way through.</p>

<p>The Moros, having seen the column
advancing on them, set to work to
block the trail leading from Bayubao<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to the Maciu fortress, thinking that the
Americans might on reaching this now
impassable entrance, decide to return
again to Camp Vicars after failing to
reach the much talked of stronghold.</p>


<h3>FOOD SUPPLY EXHAUSTED.</h3>

<p>Seeing that all else had failed, the
Americans began to construct rude
rafts with which to cross an arm of the
lake which separated them from the
Maciu territories. They succeeded in
building one in which a detachment of
Companies "C" and "M" attempted to
cross under a continued fire from the
Moros, who were entrenched on the
opposite side.</p>

<p>They kept on, however, seemingly
regardless of the rain of bullets until,
after a sharp and lively encounter with
the enemy, they found it would be
impossible to make a landing, so decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to return, but not before they had
succeeded in driving the Moros back.</p>

<p>This was the 22nd day of September,
we were now five days on the trail
in pursuit of the Moros, but had not as
yet begun to show any signs of exhaustion
from the march or exposure.</p>

<p>It was now evident that our supply
of provisions could not last much
longer, and in consideration of the fact
that the trail, now blocked by the Moros,
should be re-opened before we could
reach Maciu, it was deemed advisable
by Captain Pershing to return to Camp
Vicars, in order to rest the troops and
to procure more rations.</p>

<p>Consequently on the morning of
the 23rd, the column began the long
march from the Maciu and Sauir territory
to the Camp, arriving in good
military order at 7 p.m. same date, with
no loss to the Americans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<h3>A MUCH NEEDED REST.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/007.png" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="firstp"><span class="dcap">he troops</span> were
given five days in which to
rest and recuperate, for the
reader can easily imagine
the hardships, privations,
and sufferings which are undergone by
soldiers while on the march, especially
where there are no roads of any description,
save the narrow, rugged, and,
in many places, impassable trails, which
are met with all through the island of
Mindanao.</p>

<p>Therefore it was practically necessary
that, after six days of continual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
marching through the thick brush of
this island, they should be given ample
time in which to attain that standard of
physique which is the most characteristic
mark of the American soldier.</p>

<p>It was the morning of the 28th of
September, the bright sun had risen
gorgeously over the white tented plain,
the azure blue sky was now clear, save
a few clouds that still rested lazily on
the hill-tops, and all nature's splendors
and attractions were everywhere to be
seen.</p>

<p>To the inexperienced observer it
would seem that the Moros and Americans
were living together in happy
unison with each other in this, the
most remote of American garrisons.
But this was not so, for ere another
hour had dragged itself lazily into the
dim, misty past, the sons of fair Columbia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
were in complete readiness to
march from the camp over many a
weary mile to measure the cold steel
with the defiant, haughty, and semi-savage
Sultan of Maciu, and proud to
state, under command of Captain John
J. Pershing, to whom is justly attributed
the success, the achievements, and
all conquering abilities of the brave
soldiers under his command at Camp
Vicars.</p>


<h3>THE EXPEDITION STARTS.</h3>

<p>The expedition is complete and
after being inspected by the Commanding
General is not only complimented
by him on their general uniformity and
appearances, but are also pronounced fit
to compete with the most sanguineous
and daring adversary.</p>

<p>At 8 a.m. the command "Forward
March" was heard by every anxious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
soldier who was to be a participant in
the coming event, and amid the cheers,
farewells, and good wishes of our
comrades, we advanced in single file
from the camp over the now well known
trail leading to the territories of the
Sultan of Maciu.</p>

<p>The expedition was composed of
the same troops as that of the preceding
campaign, except in addition there
was Troop "A," 15th Cavalry.</p>

<p>The men were by this time beginning
to grow accustomed to this singular
style of marching from previous experiences,
and that, together with the
impatient anxiety they had to meet
Maciu's tribe in battle, added new
strength and vigor to every man as
onward they pressed over high hills,
through deep ravines and swift-flowing
rivers until, with the fire of military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and true national determination written
on every face, the column arrived and
halted once again on the hill-top overlooking
the now fallen stronghold of
Bayubao with which the reader is
already familiar.</p>


<h3>ENCAMPED FOR THE NIGHT.</h3>

<p>No time was lost until we were
again encamped at the foot of the hill
about 100 yards from the lake shore.
We immediately set to work to cook
our much needed supper, which was
devoured greedily by every dust-stained
warrior of the command, regardless of
the rules of etiquette, after which we
sought a "soft spot" on nature's expansive
bed, in which to lay our weary
bones for the night.</p>

<p>But even a soldier's life has, despite
its many seemingly insurmountable
obstacles, many a romantic charm,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
for who would not like to lay gently
upon the lap of earth with the soft
side of a haversack for a pillow, and
the green foliage of the graceful bamboo
trees for a canopy, and be lulled to
sleep by the wild rustling of the leaves
wafted to and fro before the gentle
zephyrs. Everything remained at a
peaceable standard during the night
with nothing to break the "chain of
silence," save the rippling of the waters
in the lake below.</p>

<p>But even a sleep such as this,
under such unusual and unaccommodating
circumstances, has an unwelcomed
limit, and ours came with the first
streaks of grey dawn that broke through
our foliaged canopied beds, and again
each soldier of American loyalty began
to kindle his fire, with which to cook
his breakfast, for on such occasions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
as this each soldier is his own cook,
waiter, and dishwasher combined.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast the real work
of opening the trail began, rifles were
quickly supplanted by shovels, picks
and axes, and in a very few moments
every soldier was equipped with tools,
which they began to use with unanimous
energy and willingness during
the greater part of the day. And it
was truly wonderful to see those brave
soldiers working untiringly, chopping
heavy trees, digging and filling deep
ravines, leveling stout barricades, all
working diligently for that one aim
which was to be the downfall of Maciu.</p>

<p>This work was kept up unceasingly
until the passage or trail was opened
to the Maciu peninsula, a distance of
two miles. It was the afternoon of the
second day, which was the 30th of September,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
before we finally reached our
destination, where there was an unexpected
surprise in store for us.</p>


<h3>FIRED UPON.</h3>

<p>The natives, having known that
our object was to cross through this
skirt of woodland, had awaited our arrival
on the opposite side. And as soon
as the first file of the "advance guard"
passed from the woods into the open
plain beyond, they met with a storm of
bullets from the enemy. They then
moved forward into the open beyond
as quickly as possible, after which they
unanimously returned the enemy's fire.
The firing was fast, and not without
effect, for ere the gloom of night began
to descend upon us, many a native of
Mindanao had sacrificed his semi-barbarous
life for his freedom.</p>

<p>It now began to grow dark, and
fearing lest we should be overtaken by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the shadows of night in the dense woods,
Captain Pershing gave orders to the
column to return to Bayubao for the
night.</p>

<p>The trail, our most important
obstruction, was now cleared and it was
with impatience and sleepless expectancy
we awaited the first glimmer of
dawn. At last came the day when the
true, fearless soldiers were to march
against Maciu's tribe. We shared together
a hurried breakfast and about 7
a.m. we advanced under the cool shadows
of the interwoven foliage, over
many a rough boulder, until after two
hours of rough marching we arrived in
the open space beyond the woods.</p>

<p>We had not marched over three-hundred
yards of this new territory
when the natives began firing at the
head of the column, but without effect,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
for as soon as the smoke from their rifles
could be seen, a volley was fired at them
by the soldiers. In a few moments we
had gained the summit of the hill, and
here we halted to await the arrival of
the Battery, which was some distance
in the rear, for not more than 400 yards
in front of the skirmish line was a fort
from which shots were fired at regular
and frequent intervals. We did not return
the fire this time, knowing as we
did that rifle fire was of no avail against
a fortification such as this proved itself
to be.</p>

<p>The Battery soon arrived, and, in
less time than it takes to relate it, they
were ready for action, being about 400
yards from the fort. As soon as the
first shot from the Artillery was fired
the Moros began to abandon the fort
and were going in the direction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Maciu. The Infantry had formed a
semi-circular skirmish line around the
stronghold and now, the Battery having
ceased firing, they began to move forward,
closing around the fort. At last
they reached it and after scaling its
high walls, they found that the greater
part of its inmates had fled, taking
their arms with them. The soldiers
soon began to destroy the fort, and in
a very few moments it was reduced to
ashes.</p>

<p>The column again took up the
trail leading towards the lake front
destroying, as they went, everything in
the shape of forts or strongholds which
they encountered, and from which they
had been fired upon.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader may think or
imagine our dealings with the Moros
of the Lake region to be of a cruel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
nature. To this I can only state that
having been amongst them since the
origin of hostilities in the island of
Mindanao, up to the present date, and
having become rather familiar with
their treachery and cruelties to American
soldiers, wherever they could get
a chance, I think as far as my judgment
is concerned that they have been
given a lesson which, to say the least,
they richly deserve.</p>

<p>We captured some five or six minor
fortifications during this day, and
towards evening we proceeded towards
the lake front, to encamp for the ensuing
night, for it was an absolute necessity
to procure water for the men and
horses, as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>That night was spent in thought,
and in anticipation of the doings of the
approaching day, for it was the day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
designated for the capture of the Maciu
stronghold. We broke camp at an
early hour and at 7 a.m. we were again
on the march, this time in a new direction.
We had not been marching
over two hours when the word was
quietly passed along the line that the
Maciu stronghold was in sight.</p>

<p>We now began to think more seriously
as we were nearing our long
looked for destination, for well we knew
that the Moros, having consolidated
here were determined to fight to the last.</p>

<p>We were, however, perfectly willing
and ready to face Maciu and his tribesmen
in open combat, and meet whatever
fate awaited us, without a murmur.</p>

<p>The column was ordered to deploy
right and left in skirmish line, and advance
towards the fort, in order that
they could more easily and readily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
command a view of the outer surroundings
of the enclosure, and prevent, if
possible, the escape of any of the blood-thirsty
Moros whose wild cries we could
now hear within.</p>

<p>The Battery, having halted in
front of the fort, was immediately
brought into action. Then suddenly a
deafening noise was heard by all, the
noise which, though too familiar to
many of us, was nevertheless to make
even a brave soldier tremble. The Artillery
had opened up on the left.
"Boom! Boom!!" went the cannons,
and a rain of solid shot and shrapnel
was hurled at the fort, and for a space
of a moment nothing could be seen but
the flying fragments, and splinters of
bamboo and debris hurled high in the
air.</p>

<p>The clouds of smoke soon cleared
away and then something happened unexpectedly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and which surprised every
American soldier in that vicinity. A
thick, black volume of smoke arose in
the direction of the fortress, then a
flash, and a deafening noise, as if the
merciless waves of the Pacific were
beating against the granite ribbed cliffs.</p>

<p>They had replied to our firing.
Boom! went the lantacas, followed by a
volley from the rifles, and then it behoved
every true American to "lay low"
for a few moments.</p>

<p>It now looked as if our expectations
were going to be fulfilled to the
last. There was a moment of silence
and again the Battery opened up in
real earnest, and a more exciting scene
could not be witnessed than to see the
havoc wrought on that fort by the guns.
Bang! Bang!! went the shots in rapid
succession, and bamboo, rocks, and flying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
fragments were hurled hundreds of
feet in every direction, but still the
Moros kept firing and crying in wild
religious ecstasy to their Mohammedan
God.</p>

<p>Captain Pershing, who had been
coolly riding about the fort to Artillery,
Infantry, and Cavalry, now decided to
order two of the guns brought to the
right of the fort. This was done immediately
and from right and left they
cut loose, determined to accomplish
their aim.</p>

<p>But instead of this, they were surprised,
when the Moros poured a withering
fire at them and crude lead balls
and fragments of iron were dropping
in the midst of the troops.</p>

<p>It was now 2 p.m. and it looked as
if Maciu's stronghold was impregnable
indeed, for we had been firing steadily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
since 9 a.m. and nothing of importance
had, as yet, been accomplished.</p>

<p>The Battery now moved towards
the fort from both sides, until they
were within fifty yards of them, and it
may be well to mention that it never
has been known in the history of battles
where Artillery has engaged an
enemy at so short a range. They had
now taken up their new positions and
began to fire at the fort from both sides,
this time with great effect. But still
the Moros remained obstinate to the
last singing wildly their religious songs
to their God "Allah" in the very midst
of the struggle.</p>

<p>The day was now drawing to a
close and yet the firing kept on. However,
at 4 p.m. the command "cease firing"
was given, and with that ended
that day's struggle for us, but not for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the natives, for they, thinking that the
Americans were about to abandon the
fort at the approach of night, still kept
up the firing. But in this they were
mistaken, for instead of returning to
the camp, the Americans still held
their position, closing in gradually on
the fort, in order to prevent the escape
of any of the Moros during the ensuing
night.</p>

<p>The commanding officer, seeing
that they were determined to hold out
until the bitter end, now issued orders
for the construction of scaling ladders
with which to gain admittance to the
fort. Work was immediately begun
on them but they were destined never
to be used for that purpose at least, for
about midnight the Moros, finding that
we were still determined to hold our
positions, decided to attempt an escape
from the enclosure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The night was unusually dark,
and the clouds were hanging low over
the lake, rendering it almost impossible
to see or distinguish an object at a
greater distance than fifty feet. The
Americans had anticipated their escape,
and consequently were in constant
readiness at all times during the night.
Then suddenly a shot was heard which
had been fired by some vigilant sentinel
on guard, then another, and another.</p>

<p>It now became evident that they
had charged the lines and were making
a dash for liberty. In an instant
every soldier was on the alert. They
kept on coming, however, seemingly
regardless of death or the rain of bullets.
But few of them escaped or even
lived to tell the tale, for as fast as they
left the fort they were being shot down
by a constant stream of fire from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Infantry, and when the morning dawned
it was found that the Sultan of Maciu,
with many another leader and
tribesman, had fallen, never to breathe
again.</p>

<p>During the struggle, the Sultan
Cabugatan of Maciu, seeing that his
efforts to suppress the Americans were
in vain, rushed into camp, bolo in hand,
in wild, frenzied excitement, determined
to slay in cold blood everybody
wearing an American uniform. But
his savage intentions were brought to
a speedy termination by the troops,
who, on seeing him approach them,
rushed towards him and overpowered
him. However, he unfortunately succeeded
in seriously wounding one of
the best and bravest soldiers in the
command, Private Richard G. Macbeth,
of Co. "F" 27th U. S. Infantry, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
bravery in time of danger had made
him an unanimous favorite among his
comrades. Another victim of this savage
Sultan was Pvt. James Nolan, Jr., of
Co. "G" 27th U. S. Infantry, who, having
been detailed as a scout, had fearlessly
advanced upon one of the forts
in order to secure, if possible, some information
regarding their position and
strength. He had reached the outer
entrance when he met a storm of bullets
from within, one of them hitting him
in the right eye, inflicting a wound
from which he suffered great pain.</p>

<p>But their sufferings were doubly
avenged, for many a hitherto unconquerable
Moro has fallen upon the
green and now deserted territories of
the Sultan of Maciu, with the bones of
his mortal composition bleaching on
the green sward, under the tropical sun
of his native skies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width:22em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where once in triumph on his trackless plains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The haughty Moro Sultan loved to reign,<br /></span>

<p>It is now January 1, 1903, and the
Moro campaign is drawn to a successful
and favorable close, and "Old Glory"
of fair "Columbia" is now unfurled to
the gentle touch of the oriental zephyrs
on the hill-tops of Mindanao, for all
time to come.</p>

</div><p class="firstp"><span class="dcap">t is</span> with feelings of pride and
national patriotism we have
watched through many a stormy
year the steady growth and accomplishments
of our immortal
Army, whose splendid display
of true valor and military discipline
has attracted the attention and well-deserved
admiration of all nations
through the universe, whether exhibited
on the expansive parade ground,
under the balmy, azure blue skies of
our Western Continent, of perpetual
freedom, or on the far away "Eastern
Isles," under the warm rays of the
tropical sun, where many a true and
stout-hearted son of "Fair Columbia"
has sacrificed his young life for his
country's cause. And as we look back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to the long misty vale of tumbled years,
in silent perusal and contemplation of
the pages of our nation's history, we
cannot help being for the moment
awestruck, as we read from those cherished
pages of the many bloody battles and
more glorious victories, which have
been won at all times, adown the ages,
since first the cold, haughty invader
sought to enter and deprive us of that
freedom for which so many of our
revered ancestors so nobly fought and
died. But although those brave warriors
of olden days have all passed
away, and the regiments, by whose gallantry
our "Stars and Stripes" was borne
to victory, are now known to us only by
name, yet we are more than proud to
be able to acknowledge to the world,
that they have been supplanted by regiments
as noteworthy as ever faced in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
combat a mortal foe. And among them,
and perhaps the most illustrious of
them all, is the gallant 27th Infantry,
whose distinguished achievements since
its organization at Plattsburg, New York,
and Fort McFerson, Ga., in the
early part of the year 1901, are unexcelled
and unequalled by any regiment
that has been ordered forth in defence of
our country and flag.</p>

<p>In December 1901, the 27th Regiment
of U. S. Infantry was ordered
from Plattsburg Barracks, N. Y., to
proceed with all haste to Manila, P. I.,
and thence to the Island of Mindanao,
to aid in suppressing and overthrowing
the semi-civilized savages, whose defiant,
inhuman, and brutal treatment
of the American soldiers was in every
sense appalling.</p>

<p>They arrived in Manila on February
3, 1902, and after encamping there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
for a few days, proceeded to the very
centre of hostilities, which was at that
time in the Island of Mindanao.</p>

<p>And since then the broad road to
civilization has been opened to the
hitherto savage Moro tribes, and chiefly
by the brave officers and men of the
27th Regiment.</p>

<p>And in conclusion we can only say
that the memories of the true, loyal,
and ever dauntless heroes of this new,
though historical regiment, who gave
and sacrificed their lives in the defence
of, and for the glory of, their country,
shall be indelibly printed on the tablets
of our memories adown the annals of
time.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_25TH_BATTERY_OF" id="THE_25TH_BATTERY_OF"></a>THE 25TH BATTERY OF
FIELD ARTILLERY.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 103px;">
<img src="images/009.png" width="103" height="100" alt="" title="" />
</div><p class="firstp"><span class="dcap">nder</span> the Army Reorganization
Bill,
passed in 1900, provision
was made for
an increase in the
number of Field Batteries,
three of which were to be equipped
entirely with mountain guns.
These were to be known as the 14th,
25th, and 28th Batteries of Field Artillery.
Two of these Batteries were to be
organized in the Philippine Islands.
These were the 14th and 25th, and
were organized by equally dividing the
number of members in what was formerly
known as Light Battery "C" of
the 7th Artillery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>The two Batteries were given their
authorized strength of 120 men each by
transferring the additional number of
men required from the Coast Artillery.</p>

<p>They were not organized, however,
until Sept. 23, 1901. About one month
later they were fully equipped as
"Mountain Batteries," and on April 1,
1902, the 25th Battery, under command
of Captain W. S. McNair, was ordered
to the Island of Mindanao, where trouble
with the Moros had long been expected.</p>

<p>The 25th Battery of Field Artillery
is equipped with four guns, which
are known as the Vickers-Maxim 75
mm. quick firing mountain guns.</p>

<p>This calibre, 75 mm., or 2.9 inches,
will be seen to be a very little less than
that of the field gun in use in our service
viz., 3.2 inches, but the power of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
this gun is much less than that of the
field gun, for the following reasons:</p>

<p>It is necessary to make a carriage
and gun whose parts shall all be within
suitable limits of weight for packing
on mules. This limit, placed on the
weight, limits the strength that can be
obtained, and also the length of the
gun itself. Therefore the amount of
powder used in these guns is much less
than the amount used in the field guns,
and the velocity of the shot when it
leaves the gun is much less (about one-half)
than it is for the field gun. The
Vickers-Maxim gun is mounted in a
cradle which has on either side a cylinder
of oil, through which the gun draws
a plunger in recoiling, and by this device
the force of the recoil is taken up
gradually and the carriage does not run
back several feet as it would otherwise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
do, so that it is at once ready to load
and fire again after each discharge.</p>

<p>The loading of the piece is very
simple. The gunner grasps a lever
which he pulls around to the right,
thereby bringing out the breech-block
and withdrawing the empty cartridge
shell last fired. The new round is
pushed into the gun, the gunner moves
the lever in the opposite direction, or
to his left, and the gun is ready to fire.</p>

<p>When the gun is to be moved it is
taken in parts for packing as follows:
The gun itself, the cradle, the trail, and
the wheels and axle, each of which is a
load for one mule.</p>

<p>The men get expert at this maneuver,
and pack up the guns at command
in a period of a little less than one
minute, while they unpack and set up
the gun ready for action with greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
speed, the record for the 25th Battery
being 20 seconds.</p>

<p>This gun is provided with various
kinds of projectiles, the ones usually
carried being shell, shrapnel and cannister,
and are known as Krupp prepared
ammunition, which can be used
in the same manner as an ordinary
rifle cartridge. The shrapnel for this,
as well as all field guns, is the projectile
mainly depended upon, and like
all field guns, the main work for them
is to fire at the personnel of the enemy.</p>

<p>It is a common error amongst military
men and others not well versed in
the use of Artillery, to suppose that a
field gun is intended for the purpose of
making breaches in walls.</p>

<p>The fallacy of this idea can be seen
at once by making an examination of
the projectiles, which will be found to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
contain only the quantity of powder
which you could hold in the palm
of your hand. The shells contain 10
ounces, the shrapnel 3, the cannister a
little more than 2. Thus it may be readily
seen that the guns used by the 25th
Battery are not such destructive engines
of war after all, but to those who
would doubt their effectiveness, we
should simply say: "Go and witness
them in action."</p>

<p>Enough has been said to give the
reader a correct idea of what a "Mountain
Battery" is, with the history of
what is known as the 25th Battery of
Field Artillery, and thereby the object
of the writer has been accomplished.</p>
